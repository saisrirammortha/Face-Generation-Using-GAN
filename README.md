# Face-Generation-Using-GAN
Generative adversarial networks
* This project was a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.
* Built Generative Adversarial Networks ( Generator and Discriminator) to generate Celeb Images similar to that of CelebA Dataset
* The Original Link to the dataset is provided [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).
* I have used a small chunk of the dataset. It is present in this repository.The link to the dataset i have used is provided [here](https://github.com/saisrirammortha/Face-Generation-Using-GAN/tree/master/processed_celeba_small)
* The main goal of this project is to generate new Celeb Images similar to that of CelebA Dataset

## Requirements
* If you don't have python installed on your machine download it from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe)
* Then install pip on your machine by downloading this [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and from the downloads directory and  run ```python get-pip.py```
* To start working on the project run the following command after cloning the repository.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* I suppose Anaconda is already installed in the machine. Then run the following command
```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

This would install all the requirements.
## Output
* The dataset contains images of celebs(CelebA dataset).
* Did some preprocessing on the data using **PyTorch Transforms**
